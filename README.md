# Alpha_Flappy_Bird
===================
Q-learning method to play flappy-bird like game automatically.

AlphaGo attracted so many interests around the world, and made the word machine learning even more popular. Alpha Flappy Bird is the frist shot I made in machine learning (more or less). In the first place, I just wanted to practice my Python skill and try something new and exicting.(It is the second year I learn Python)
I used a so-called Q-learning method to realize it. (Reference: http://mnemstudio.org/path-finding-q-learning-tutorial.htm) The basic idea is just find a way to "memorize" the results of each actions in different situations. By experience accumulated, it then can master the flappy-bird like game.
